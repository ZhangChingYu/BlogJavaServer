Building My Personal Website

[I]
In the starting point of building this website, I have to figure out a lot of new things. The first thing to do is to decide what the website is about. However, I can’t decide between a life sharing blog or a skill presenting platform. Therefore, I made my choice to do both. It feels a little bit like building two websites at once for example I’ve to design the web pages for two completely different themes and code them out.

I'm still using Figma to design the user interface and expect to start programming in 10 days. I will be building a React.js website with a Django server.
